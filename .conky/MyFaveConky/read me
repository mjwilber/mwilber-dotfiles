This is my 'favorite conky' that I am using right now. I use Ubuntu and this conky uses Ubuntu fonts.

I have modified and borrowed from different sources on the net and this site.

My conky is actually 8 files working together.

The first file is the 'startupconky.sh' file that should go in the /bin folder in your /home folder.  You can 
   click this file to run conky or better, add to your 'startup applications.'

The other seven files are the main conky files and are located in the '.my_fave_conky' folder.  This folder should
   go in your /home folder.

Add the 'ip.sh' file to your /.scripts folder in your /home folder.

The font I use for the clock (called 'computerfont') is here --> http://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/Computerfont.htm
   Put the font in your /.fonts folder in your /home folder.  Then update your fonts in terminal with 'fc-cache -v -f' and you are set!

The colors are easy to change.  Just open each file and look for the color section and change the color, then save.

Enjoy, and modify to your taste!
